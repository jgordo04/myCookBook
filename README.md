# myCookBook

## Summary

myCookBook is a databse for a user to store recipes they have found online. It will store them in categories and format them into a nice readable format.

## UI description

The first page will be a login page. Then it will take you to a view that is your "cookbook" which lists recipes you have saved to your database. Then there will be a page to add recipes. You will put the url of a recipe you want and it will scrape the website for ingredients and directions, show you a sample of the format for you to modify if you choose, then allow you to save it to your cookbook. Potentially adding a search to search for recipes online to grab and save.
